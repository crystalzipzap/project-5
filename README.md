# Project 5: Add a GUI to Elementary Cellular Automaton using JavaFX

**Per Dr. Jabrzemski, only four of the highest project grades count toward the final grade. Hence, if you are satisfied with the grades you have earned on the past projects, Project 5 is completely optional.**

## Summary

Project 5 will give you an opportunity to create a graphical user interface (GUI) and turn what you have completed in Project 2 and Project 3 into a desktop application. Your application should `include, but is not limited to, these functions below`: 

* Dropdown menus to indicate rule type, rule number, and boundary conditions
* Input initial generation
* Display automaton 
* Calculate and graph Hamming distance and subrule counts

## Due Date

To be finalized by Dr. Jabrzemski
